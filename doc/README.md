Intro
---------------------
Amigacoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
---------------------
See the documentation at (http://www.amigacoin.org) and doc folder for help and more information.
